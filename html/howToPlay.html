        <p class="intro rules">
          1. At the beginning of the game, the deck is shuffled and distributed evenly between you and your opponent.
        </p>
        <p class="intro rules">
          2. Every card has a set of stats associated with it - attack, defence, speed, stealth and strength.
        </p>
        <p class="intro rules">
          3. You begin by choosing a stat on your top card - choose wisely! The stats range in value from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).
        </p>
        <p class="intro rules">
          4. Once you have chosen the declared stat for your character, it is then compared with the corresponding stat on your opponent's top card.
        </p>
        <p class="intro rules">
          5. Whoever has the higher stat wins the round - the winner collects both top cards, puts them to the back of their card pack, and chooses the next declared stat from their new top card.
        </p>
        <p class="intro rules">
          6. If, during a round, there is a draw between stats, then both cards are 'wagered', and we enter a tie-break round. The current declarer then picks a new stat from their next card, to be compared with the corresponding stat on the opponents next card. The winner of this round then takes all cards (including the wagered cards) and puts them to the back of their deck. If the tie-break round also ends in a draw, then further tie-break rounds are played until someone wins a round, and that player then gets to take all wagered cards.
        </p>
        <p class="intro rules">
          7. The loser is the person who is first to be left without any cards, and thus the winner is left with all of them - good luck!
