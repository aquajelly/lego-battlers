# lego-battlers

A browser game based on the popular game, Top Trumps. Every card is a lego
character, with different stats. It is user v computer; the turn-taker declares
a stat on their top card, and then the opponent will reveal the corresponding
stat on their top card. Whoever has the higher stat wins the opponents card,
and then has another go with their next card. If at any time a stat is equal
on both cards, they are both held in the middle as a 'wager' - the previous
turn-taker then has another turn, and the winner of this round also wins the
wagered cards. If this second turn is also a draw, then the cards are also
placed in the middle, and the process continues until someone wins a round.

Once a player run out of cards, then the opponent is declared the winner.
